    "Recommendation algorithms provide the customers of companies such as Netflix, Amazon and YouTube intelligent suggestions about the items they might be interested in. There are many alternative approaches to constructing such algorithms. One of them is called **content-based filtering**, which uses the items' metadata (or descriptive characteristics) as explanatory variables to *e.g.* create models for identifying similar items than those the customer has previously expressed interest to. However, in this module we shall focus on another very common technique called **collaborative filtering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering generates recommendations about what the user might enjoy on the basis of collected reactions from other users. This technique can be approached from two alternative directions: **item-based** (looking for items that elicit similar reactions) or **user-based** (looking for users with similar tastes) collaborative filtering. Below, we shall investigate both of these alternative approaches.  "

Next, comparing the last two rows of numbers in the above table, we find that M4 has a rating history that has some similarities with that of M3 (for example, both U1 and U2 have given these two movies the same ratings). In contrast, the ratings received by M1 (the first row) are clearly different from those received by M3 (and fairly similar to those of M2, which U4 did not like).
