    "## Getting Started: Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This course aims to provide an introduction to data analysis and machine learning with Python. You will learn ideas and concepts about how to extract useful information from gathered data - in order to gain important new insights and draw interesting conclusions from its contents. Such information is often not easily or directly attainable, and can only be accessed with the help of specialized methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language offers a large number of libraries for analysing and manipulating data. A convenient way to get started is by installing a free Python distribution called *Anaconda* (www.anaconda.com). In addition to standard libraries, Anaconda automatically incorporates many of the central data science tools and packages - including *Jupyter Notebook*, a web-based interactive environment, which provides a platform to write and execute Python code and complement it with explanatory text and rich annotations. All the material for this course (including this document) will be provided as notebook documents, denoted by the `.ipynb` extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the Anaconda distribution, you will find Jupyter Notebook among the installed applications. On launching it, a directory listing opens up in a web browser. You can either locate and select an existing notebook for opening, or create a new notebook: press the button \"New\" in upper right corner of the page, and select \"Notebook: Python 3 (ipykernel)\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebook documents contain two kinds of cells: *code cells* for writing and executing Python code, and *markdown cells* (like this one) for annotation purposes. To run the code in one of the code cells, select the cell first and then either press SHIFT + ENTER, or the \"Run\" button in the above toolbar. The interactive-mode IPython interpreter then displays the resulting output (if any) for inspection. With markdown cells, you can create explanatory content to accompany your code; for additional information, see e.g. https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** When the notebook is reopened after closing it, the kernel restarts, and all the variables from before are lost; you will have to execute the code again to restore their values. Also, when working with notebooks and constantly rewriting and executing the cells, sometimes errors might creep up and cause the kernel to crash or the notebook to get stuck. In this case, it is usually a good idea to restart the kernel and execute its cells all over again; this can conveniently be accomplished by selecting \"Restart & Run All\" from the \"Kernel\" dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the next step, execute the first code cell right below to import two Python modules: **NumPy** is a basic package for scientific computing, whereas the **pandas** library is a specialized library for reading and manipulating data. These two libraries form the background for any data analysis project with Python. In the following, we take a brief look at both of them."

    "NumPy is an open-source extension library of Python for comprehensive and efficient numerical computation.\n",

    "In particular, the NumPy library introduces a powerful new object called *ndarray* (N-dimensional array), or *array* for short, which can be thought of as an enhanced version of lists in standard Python. NumPy arrays have many useful computational features, which are optimized for rapid execution. Practically all data analysis and machine learning libraries are based on using NumPy arrays in the background. Below, we get acquainted with some of their basic properties.\n",

    "The data is now available for further analyzing as a pandas *DataFrame* object; it has the form of a table with 150 rows and 5 columns (for clarity, only a few rows from the beginning and the end of the table are displayed). Each row in the data corresponds to a single flower **sample**, and the columns of the data represent the recorded **features** of the samples. In this dataset, each sample is characterized by five recorded features: four *numerical* features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width) and one *categorical* feature (species). The leftmost column in the output containing the unique row indices from 0 to 149 is auto-generated by pandas, and not part of the actual data. The column index names are set according to the header row of the CSV file.\n",

Numerical features usually represent results of measurements; their values can be ordered in a meaningful way, and often vary on a continuous scale.

    "Assume now that you encounter a new iris flower sample, of which you have access to the measured values of the lengths and widths of its petals and sepals. You are, however, not aware of the variety of this new sample, but would instead like to make a sensible prediction about which of the three possible iris species it belongs to. More precisely, consider that you are expected to write a computer program for accomplishing this task: the program should first ask the user for the numerical values of the four measured dimensions, and then output the name of the predicted category. How would you set about solving such a task? \n",
    "\n",
    "The early approaches for solving these kinds of problems involved first gathering domain-specific knowledge related to the task, expressing these in terms of a set of rules and, finally, converting these rules to program code. While this type of approach could be quite useful for some simple and well-defined tasks, this is not the case for many interesting and important problem categories (such as computer vision and pattern recognition). For more complex tasks, much better results can be obtained by using methods of **machine learning**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, there is no need for the programmer to explicitly figure out and implement the specific rules for solving the problem under consideration. Instead, these rules are **automatically extracted from data**. In terms of our iris example, this means that the programmer does not need to study botany, or interview a botanist, in order to find out explicit rules for identifying the correct species. Instead, the classifier (the computer program for predicting the iris variety) can be constructed directly from the contents of the dataset containing 150 examples of inputs and outputs. Of course, the quality of such a classifier is very much dependent on the quality of the available data, and needs to be tested before deployment. The (often iterative) process of building a machine-learning model is called **training** the model, and the dataset used for this purpose is called the **training set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different categories of problems within machine learning. The above example, where the value of a categorical target variable (variety) has to be predicted in terms of a set of input variables, is a **classification** problem. If the target variable varies on a continuous scale instead of being categorical, the problem is that of **regression**; one might *e.g.* wish to estimate the prize of an apartment in terms of the input values defining its size, number or rooms, age, neighborhood etc. Whenever the training set contains the true (correct) values of the target variable for the training samples, the problem is that of **supervised learning**. This, however, is not always the case. As an example, consider the iris dataset without the variety column, containing only the values of the four numerical dimensions for each sample. One might *e.g.* ask whether this set of 150 samples could be divided in three subsets so that each of them contains samples \"similar\" to each other, but distinct from those in other subsets. Such **clustering** problems are often encountered in the context of market segmentation, and \n",
    " belong to the category of **unsupervised learning**.     \n",

    "During this course, we learn methods and tools for dealing with these kinds of problems, and much more. \n",
